# Airbnb_Local_ML
In this project I have implemented regression models on Airbnb dataset to predict prices and also implemented classification models on Local dataset to predict income category.
I have used Gridsearch and Cross-Validation techniques for hyper-parameter tuning and model generalization, respectively.
I have given dataset and objective description in ipynb file itself, and comments describing all the steps and methods I used has been provided.
